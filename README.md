# AppointmentsApp
A simple program that is designed for users to register, add, and remove appointments, as well as see one's current list. A side project to practice data structures (creating own data structures like User, and using existing ones like ArrayList). Originally made with vaccine appointments in mind, but extended to all appointments to be more general.

# Future Improvements
- A way to store user information locally so that registration is not required everytime on each run of the program
- GUI implementation with Swing
